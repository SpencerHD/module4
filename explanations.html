		<h1><strong>Explanations - CIS255 Bootstrap</strong></h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>Classes Used</strong></h3>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>navbar</u></strong></h4>
		<p>The <strong>navbar</strong> was used to create a navigation pane on the top of the webpage. I created 5 buttons, with the company's
		logo that redirects you home, and also styled the bar to be a certain color, and have certain padding to fit all the content on.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>collpase navbar-collapse</u></strong></h4>
		<p>Using <strong>collpase navbar-collapse</strong>, I was able to customize the buttons used in the navigation bar to change into a
		expandable and collapsable button that shows and hides all of the buttons on a mobile web version of the page.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>btn-primary</u></strong></h4>
		<p>This property, <strong>btn-primary</strong>, was used with the button on the home page of the webpage. It sits inside the first
		image of the carousel slide, and includes a link to take the user to this page.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>btn-lg</u></strong></h4>
		<p>As a property that affects the size of a button, <strong>btn-lg</strong> simply specifies whether the button is large, rather
		than small. If you were to make a smaller button, use <i>btn-sm</i> as an alternative to this property. I used this to make the
		button I used larger underneath the caption of the carousel.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>carousel slide</u></strong></h4>
		<p>In order to create a image slideshow that spans the header of the page, <strong>carousel slide</strong> is a property that
		implements this idea. The slideshow only exists on the home page, but will scroll through different images of the business,
		as well as giving the user options to go to the next image or previous image.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>carousel-caption</u></strong></h4>
		<p><strong>Carousel-caption</strong> is a useful property that adds a caption inside the image carousel the user creates. You can
		modify the text anyway you choose, and also change the alignment of the text you add. I used this property to create essnetially
		the "title" of the webpage.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>text-center</u></strong></h4>
		<p><strong>Text-center</strong> is an alignment property for text that aligns all text within that container or just that specific
		text to the center of the page. I used this property within several containers to center my text, as well as <i>text-left</i> to
		align text within my containers for the page, so the text doesn't sit on the far end of the page.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>text-uppercase</u></strong></h4>
		<p>As an alternative to typing it yourself, <strong>text-uppercase</strong> is a property that changes all text specified to appear
		in all UPPERCASE, regardless of how the target text has been typed. I used this property to ensure my title for the webpage would
		always appear in uppercase text.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>collapse</u></strong></h4>
		<p>While creating the collpasable button for the mobile version of the navbar, <strong>collapse</strong> is the property you would
		use to invoke that action. In my webpage, its used in the mobile version to show all the navbar options, and within this property
		I was able to customize how the button would look, as well.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><strong><u>col-sm-#</u></strong></h4>
		<p>When specifying how many columns the coder wants and how wide each one should be, <strong>col-sm-#</strong> is the property used
		to create those columns for your webpage. I used these in the footer of the pages to create three columns for a search bar, the 
		Facebook link, and the Twitter link for the business.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3><strong>WordPress vs. Bootstrap</strong></h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="container text-left">
		<p>I found this assignment a bit challenging, but I also felt very accomplished when it was completed for the end product.
		The main difference between using WordPress or using Bootstrap is how you create the webpage itself. With WordPress, a lot of the 
		content you create is visual based and requires less coding, but that also makes it easier for users who don't have much experience 
		with coding to make their own webpage. Bootstrap, however, is much more hands-on. You really are essentially making a webpage 
		"from-scratch," and this allows you to better customize your webpage to look like whatever you design. Essentially, Bootstrap 
		requires more coding, but allows you to customize much more than WordPress allows.</p>
		<p>When talking about usability, Bootstrap requires you to specify exactly how you would like something to appear on the page.
    For instance, the navigation bar at the top of the page only requires you to add the links to different webpages and where
    you want those links to go in WordPress. Bootstrap, however, has you customize the color of the bar, the padding, the icon size,
    and much more as you continue on with building your page. Coding a webpage from scratch gives you the ability to change just about
    everything you would like to, where you don't have that freedom when using a service like WordPress. I preferred the freedom and
    choices of using bootstrap, although it was more difficult, and would be able to further customize my webpage if I chose to in the
    future.</p>
